# Alerta

This is the inital setup that I have for the app.  The functionality is there.  When using the app for this first time, allow all permissions. If you don't it's going to give an error an exit the app. I know what the problem and how to fix we can discuss this on next meeting.  I don't want to merge to master yet since there is a bug. Look at the app, think of functionality, use cases for the user, and in next meeting we can plan accordingly how to start developing.

## Flow
Select contacts -> allow all perms -> press button to send sms.
